                   offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected
                   open access locations. This book characterizes a
                   notion of type that covers both linguistic and
                   non-linguistic action, and lays the foundations for a
                   theory of action based on a Theory of Types with
                   Records (TTR). Robin Cooper argues that a theory of
                   language based on action allows the adoption of a
                   perspective on linguistic content that is centred on
                   interaction in dialogue; this approach is crucially
                   different to the traditional view of natural
                   languages as essentially similar to formal languages
                   such as logics developed by philosophers or
                   mathematicians. At the same time, he claims that the
                   substantial technical advantages made by the formal
                   language view of semantics can be incorporated into
                   the action-based view, and that this can lead to
                   important improvements in both intuitive
                   understanding and empirical coverage. This enterprise
                   uses types rather than possible worlds as commonly
                   employed in studies of the semantics of natural
                   language. Types are more tractable than possible
                   worlds and offer greater potential for understanding
                   the implementation of semantics both on machines and
                   in biological brains.},

  abstract =      {This article suggests that the parser underlying
                   human syntax may have originally evolved to assist
                   navigation, a claim supported by computational
                   simulations as well as evidence from neuroscience and
                   psychology. We discuss two independent conjectures
                   about the way in which navigation could have
                   supported the emergence of this aspect of the human
                   language faculty: firstly, by promoting the
                   development of a parser; and secondly, by possibly
                   providing a topic of discussion to which this parser
                   could have been applied with minimum effort. The
                   paper summarizes our previously published experiments
                   and provides original results in support of the
                   evolutionary advantages this type of communication
                   can provide, compared with other foraging strategies.
                   Another aspect studied in the experiments is the
                   combination and range of environmental factors that
                   make communication beneficial, focusing on the
                   availability and volatility of resources. We suggest
                   that the parser evolved for navigation might
                   initially have been limited to handling regular
                   languages, and describe a mechanism that may have
                   created selective pressure for a context-free
                   parser.},

                   the cumulative cultural evolution of language. In
                   doing so we provide the first experimental validation
                   for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to
                   the appearance of design without a designer. Our
                   experiments involve the iterated learning of
                   artificial languages by human participants. We show
                   that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such
                   a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over
                   time, the languages in our experiments become easier
                   to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore,
                   this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the
                   transmission of language over generations, without
                   any intentional design on the part of individual
                   language learners. Previous computational and
                   mathematical models suggest that iterated learning
                   provides an explanation for the structure of human
                   language and link particular aspects of linguistic
                   structure with particular constraints acting on
                   language during its transmission. The experimental
                   work presented here shows that the predictions of
                   these models, and models of cultural evolution more
                   generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

                   However, stochastic neural networks rarely use
